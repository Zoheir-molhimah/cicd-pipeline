  - API endpoints
  - Server logic
  - Authentication
  - Server configuration

---

## **🛡️ Conflict Prevention Strategy**

### **1. File Ownership & Isolation**

#### **Frontend Developer (Developer 1):**
```bash
# Your working branch
git checkout developer/frontend

# Your files to work on:
- src/client/          # All client-side code
- public/              # Static assets
- webpack.config.js     # Frontend build config
- package.json          # Frontend dependencies
```

#### **React & Database Developer (Developer 2):**
```bash
# Your working branch
git checkout developer/react-database

# Your files to work on:
- src/components/       # React components
- src/pages/          # React pages
- database/           # Database files
- migrations/         # Database migrations
- src/models/         # Data models
```

#### **Backend API Developer (Developer 3):**
```bash
# Your working branch
git checkout developer/backend-api

# Your files to work on:
- src/server.js       # Main server file
- src/routes/         # API routes
- src/middleware/     # Server middleware
- src/auth/          # Authentication logic
- src/config/        # Server configuration
```

## **🔄 Daily Workflow for Each Developer**

### **Step 1: Start Your Day**
```bash
# Always start by updating your branch
git checkout developer/[your-branch]
git pull origin develop  # Get latest changes from develop
git merge develop       # Merge any new changes
git push origin developer/[your-branch]
```

### **Step 2: Work on Your Features**
```bash
# Create feature branches from your developer branch
git checkout -b feature/[your-feature-name]
# Make your changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: [your feature description]"
git push origin feature/[your-feature-name]
```

### **Step 3: Test Your Changes**
```bash
# Run tests to ensure nothing breaks
npm run test
npm run lint
npm run build

# If tests pass, merge back to your developer branch
git checkout developer/[your-branch]
git merge feature/[your-feature-name]
git push origin developer/[your-branch]
```

### **Step 4: Create Pull Request**
```bash
# Create PR from your developer branch to develop
# This triggers code review and CI/CD checks
```

---

## **🚨 Conflict Prevention Rules**

### **1. File Locking Strategy**
- **Never edit files outside your responsibility area**
- **Always communicate before touching shared files**
- **Use feature flags for incomplete features**

### **2. Shared Files Protocol**
If you need to modify shared files (like `package.json`):
```bash
# 1. Announce in team chat
# 2. Create a shared branch
git checkout -b shared/[feature-name]
# 3. Make changes
# 4. Get team approval
# 5. Merge to develop together
```

### **3. Database Changes**
```bash
# Always create migration files
# Never modify existing database structure directly
# Use version-controlled migrations
```

---

## **📋 Branch Protection Rules**

### **Main Branch Protection:**
- ✅ Require pull request reviews
- ✅ Require status checks to pass
- ✅ Require branches to be up to date
- ✅ Restrict pushes to main branch

### **Develop Branch Protection:**
- ✅ Require pull request reviews
- ✅ Require CI/CD checks to pass
- ✅ Allow force pushes (for hotfixes)

---

## **🔄 Integration Workflow**

### **Daily Integration Process:**
1. **Morning Sync**: All developers pull latest `develop`
2. **Work Independently**: On your respective branches
3. **Evening Integration**: Merge completed features to `develop`
4. **Weekly Release**: Merge `develop` to `main` for production

### **Conflict Resolution:**
```bash
# If conflicts occur during merge:
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout developer/[your-branch]
git merge develop
# Resolve conflicts manually
git add .
git commit -m "resolve: Merge conflicts with develop"
git push origin developer/[your-branch]
```

---

## **🧪 Testing Strategy**

### **Individual Testing:**
```bash
# Each developer tests their changes
npm run test
npm run lint
npm run build
npm run dev  # Test locally
```

### **Integration Testing:**
```bash
# Before merging to develop
git checkout develop
git merge developer/[your-branch]
npm run test
npm run build
# If tests pass, push to develop
```

## **📊 Monitoring & Communication**

### **Daily Standup Checklist:**
- [ ] What did you work on yesterday?
- [ ] What are you working on today?
- [ ] Any blockers or conflicts?
- [ ] Any shared files you need to modify?

### **Communication Channels:**
- **Slack/Discord**: For quick questions
- **GitHub Issues**: For bug reports
- **Pull Request Comments**: For code reviews
- **Daily Standup**: For coordination

## **🚀 Quick Commands for Each Developer**

### **Frontend Developer:**
```bash
# Setup
git clone https://github.com/Zoheir-molhimah/cicd-pipeline.git
cd cicd-pipeline
git checkout developer/frontend

# Daily workflow
git pull origin develop
# Work on frontend files
npm run dev  # Test frontend changes
git add src/client/ public/ webpack.config.js
git commit -m "feat: Frontend feature"
git push origin developer/frontend
```

### **React & Database Developer:**
```bash
# Setup
git checkout developer/react-database

# Daily workflow
git pull origin develop
# Work on React components and database
npm run test  # Test React components
npm run build  # Test database changes
git add src/components/ src/pages/ database/ migrations/
git commit -m "feat: React component and database update"
git push origin developer/react-database
```

### **Backend API Developer:**

## **⚠️ Important Rules**

### **DO:**
- ✅ Always work on your assigned branch
- ✅ Pull latest changes before starting work
- ✅ Test your changes before pushing
- ✅ Create feature branches for new features
- ✅ Communicate before touching shared files

### **DON'T:**
- ❌ Work directly on `main` or `develop`
- ❌ Edit files outside your responsibility
- ❌ Push untested code
- ❌ Merge without code review
- ❌ Work on the same file simultaneously

---

## **🆘 Emergency Procedures**

### **If Conflicts Occur:**
1. **Stop working** on conflicting files
2. **Communicate** with team immediately
3. **Create backup branch** of your work
4. **Resolve conflicts** together
5. **Test thoroughly** before merging

### **If Build Breaks:**
1. **Check CI/CD logs** for specific errors
2. **Identify** which developer's changes caused it
3. **Revert** problematic changes
4. **Fix** the issue in a new branch
5. **Test** before re-merging

---

**🎯 This workflow ensures all 3 developers can work simultaneously without conflicts!**
